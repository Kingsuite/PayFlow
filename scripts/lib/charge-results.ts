/**
 * lib/charge-results.ts — the single off-chain decoder for `ChargeResult`.
 *
 * `ChargeResult` is a Soroban `#[contracttype]` enum with no payload fields
 * (contract/src/batch.rs), so on the wire each element is an `scvU32` that
 * carries the variant discriminant — NOT an `scvSymbol`. The whole return
 * value of `batch_charge` / `get_batch_charge_estimate` is an `scvVec` of
 * those, one element per input address, in input order.
 *
 * The variant table below is the declaration order of the enum. The
 * discriminants are append-only: a new variant must be appended, and
 * renumbering an existing one breaks every decoder that was ever written.
 * `scripts/__tests__/keeper-decode.test.ts` diffs this table against
 * contract/src/batch.rs so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * See docs/charge-results.md for the full wire-format reference.
