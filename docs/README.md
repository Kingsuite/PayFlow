## Documentation tooling

These checks keep the docs in sync with the code. Run them from the repository root unless noted; each exits non-zero on failure.

| Command | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `node check-doc-links.mjs` | Every relative link and `#anchor` in every Markdown file resolves; reports orphaned Markdown files (orphans under `docs/` fail — link them from this page). |
| `node scripts/emit-caps-table.mjs --check` | [limits.md](limits.md) matches the constants in `contract/src/caps.rs`. Drop `--check` to print the table. |
| `node scripts/gen-undocumented-scripts.mjs --check` | The generated script-reference block in [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md) matches the flags and env vars the scripts read. Drop `--check` to print the block. |
| `node scripts/check-quicklinks.mjs` | The quick-link table in [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md) points at the correct heading anchors. |
| `node scripts/check-error-codes.mjs` | [ERROR-CODES.md](ERROR-CODES.md) lists every code in `contract/src/errors.rs`, with no duplicates. |
| `cd scripts && npx tsx lint-duplicates.ts` (or `npm run lint:duplicates`) | Every script under `scripts/` parses and has no duplicate declarations or object keys (baseline in `scripts/.duplicate-lint-baseline.json`). |
| `cd scripts && node lint-duplicates.mjs` | No `.ts` file under `scripts/` has two non-type imports from the same module. |

Copy-paste all of the root-level checks at once:

```bash
node check-doc-links.mjs
node scripts/emit-caps-table.mjs --check
node scripts/gen-undocumented-scripts.mjs --check
node scripts/check-quicklinks.mjs
node scripts/check-error-codes.mjs
```
