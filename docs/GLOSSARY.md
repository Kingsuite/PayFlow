# PayFlow Glossary

> PayFlow uses a number of domain-specific terms in its contract and docs. This glossary defines those terms alphabetically and links to the most relevant source materials.

## A

### Active Count

The number of subscriptions currently considered active by the contract. It changes when users subscribe and cancel. See the `ActiveCount` storage key and `get_active_count()`.

Source: `contract/src/subscription_count.rs`, `DataKey::ActiveCount`.

### Admin

The privileged address authorized to perform administrative actions (initialization, configuration changes, proposals, and commits). Admin actions are generally protected by `require_auth()` checks. The current admin may be transferred via a two-step workflow.

Source: `contract/src/admin.rs`, `DataKey::Admin`, `transfer_admin()` / `accept_admin()`.

See also: [Two-Step Authorization](#two-step-authorization).

### Amount Limits

Hard caps on one-time payment and subscription amounts, expressed in token base units. `MAX_AMOUNT` limits a single `pay_per_use()` call; `MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_AMOUNT` limits a subscription charge.

Source: [`limits.md`](./limits.md), `contract/src/validation.rs`.

See also: [`API.md`](./API.md), [Daily Limit](#daily-limit).

### Append-only Subscriber Index

A persistent list-like structure used to track subscriber addresses for iteration and paging patterns. It supports reading “subscriber at index” without rewriting the full list each time. The contract keeps an associated size counter.

Source: `contract/src/subscription_count.rs`, `DataKey::SubscriberIndex(i)` and `SubscriberIndexSize`.

### Auto-Resume

A bounded pause set with `pause_until()` is cleared lazily by the next `charge()` or `batch_charge()` after its expiry. Soroban does not run a timer, so an expired pause remains stored until a charge attempt or explicit `resume()`.

Source: [`pause-lifecycle.md`](./architecture/pause-lifecycle.md#auto-resume-on-charge--batch_charge).

See also: [`SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md`](./SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md), [`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md).

## B

### Batch Charge

A permissionless operation that attempts to charge multiple subscribers in one transaction. Instead of failing the whole transaction on ordinary eligibility issues, it returns per-user outcomes. This improves throughput for the keeper workflow.

Source: `contract/src/batch.rs`, `batch_charge()`.

## C

### CancelResult

Per-address outcome returned by `batch_cancel()`. Its append-only variants are encoded as `u32` discriminants; the result describes cancellation without requiring a separate event for each address.

Source: [`API.md`](./API.md), [`cancel-results.md`](./cancel-results.md).

See also: [`EVENT-MAPPING.md`](../scripts/EVENT-MAPPING.md).

### ChargeResult

Per-address outcome returned by `batch_charge()` and `get_batch_charge_estimate()`. A non-`Charged` result for one user **never aborts** the rest of the batch. Variants are append-only in the contract (discriminants 0-6); do not reorder when extending.

On the wire each variant is an `scvU32` carrying its discriminant, **not** an `scvSymbol` or a string. See [`charge-results.md`](./charge-results.md) for the byte-level encoding, worked hex examples, and decoders.

Source: `contract/src/batch.rs`, [`charge-results.md`](./charge-results.md).

| Variant | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Charged` | Funds transferred (live) or precheck passed (estimate) |
| `Skipped` | Billing interval has not elapsed |
| `NoSubscription` | No subscription record for the address |
| `Inactive` | Subscription cancelled |
| `Paused` | Subscription paused (including unexpired `pause_until`) |
| `GracePeriodElapsed` | Charge window closed after grace period |
| `AllowanceInsufficient` | Token allowance below gross `sub.amount`; subscription stays active |

Canonical table: [`KEEPER.md`](./KEEPER.md#how-a-cycle-works). Type definition: `contract/src/batch.rs`.

`ChargeResult::AllowanceInsufficient` is discriminant 6: the batch checks allowance before token transfer and returns this per-user outcome without aborting the batch. It is distinct from `InsufficientAllowance` (contract error code 8), which is a transaction error on other paths.

See also: [`charge-results.md`](./charge-results.md), [`KEEPER.md`](./KEEPER.md), [`ERROR-CODES.md`](./ERROR-CODES.md).

### ChargeSimResult

Read-only simulation enum returned only by `simulate_charge()`. Unlike `ChargeResult`, it distinguishes `ContractPaused`, `NotDue`, and `InsufficientAllowance`, and collapses missing/inactive subscriptions into `Inactive`. Never panics for ordinary eligibility outcomes.

Source: `contract/src/charge_exec.rs`, [`API.md`](./API.md#chargesimresult).

See also: [`PayPerUseSimResult`](#payperusesimresult), [`ChargeResult`](#chargeresult).

### Contract Paused

A global state flag that blocks most user-facing write operations (subscription write paths) while enabled. Read-only methods generally continue to work. The contract provides `pause_contract()` / `unpause_contract()` and `is_contract_paused()`.

Source: `contract/src/lib.rs`, `contract/src/storage.rs`, `DataKey::ContractPaused`.

### Charge Grace Window

A time window after the scheduled billing time during which a charge is still considered valid. If the grace period elapses, charging returns a grace-related error/result. The window is controlled by grace-period proposal and commit calls.

Source: `contract/src/grace.rs`, `ContractError::GracePeriodElapsed`, `DataKey::GracePeriod`.

### Charge History

A stored list/vector of charge timestamps associated with a subscriber. The contract caps the list length (documented as “up to 12”) and supports paging and clearing. Used for analytics and to validate billing behavior.

Source: `contract/src/subscription_history.rs`, `DataKey::ChargeHistory(user)`.

### Contract Schema Version

An integer representing the current on-chain storage schema version (`DataKey::SchemaVersion`). Updated by admin `migrate()`; exposed via `get_schema_version()`. **Default when unset: `0` (unmigrated).** **Current target: `3`** (`CURRENT_VERSION` in `contract/src/migration.rs`: v1→v2 adds `paused`; v2→v3 backfills `referrer` on subscriptions).

Do not confuse with marketing “schema v3” shorthand in issues — the on-chain field is a plain `u32` incremented by migration steps.

Source: `contract/src/migration.rs`, [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md#storage-strategy).

### Contract Health Check

On-chain diagnostic via `contract_health_check()` returning [`HealthReport`](#healthreport). Aggregates protocol-level flags (`contract_paused`, token/admin configured, `schema_version`, volume utilization). **`is_healthy`** is `true` when the contract is unpaused, token and admin are set, and `instance_ttl_ledgers > 17_280`. This is **not** the keeper HTTP `/health` endpoint and **not** per-user [`SubscriptionHealth`](#subscriptionhealth).

Source: [`API.md`](./API.md#contract_health_check), [`MAINNET-DEPLOYMENT.md`](./MAINNET-DEPLOYMENT.md#3-health).

## D

### Daily Limit

A temporary per-subscriber cap that restricts total spendable amount via `pay_per_use()` within an approximate 24-hour TTL. It is set by `set_daily_limit()` and enforced on each one-time payment. The contract stores both the configured limit and the accumulated spend.

Source: `contract/src/spending_limit.rs`, `DataKey::DailyLimit(user)`, `DataKey::DailySpent(user)`.

See also: [`DailyLimitStatus`](#dailylimitstatus), [`DAILY-LIMITS.md`](./DAILY-LIMITS.md).

### Daily Limit Window

The rolling ~24-hour TTL window shared by `DailyLimit(user)` and `DailySpent(user)` temporary storage entries. Both keys are extended together on each qualifying `pay_per_use()`; when the window expires, limit and spent counters reset. Distinct from billing **grace period** (recurring charge eligibility).

Source: `contract/src/spending_limit.rs`, [`DAILY-LIMITS.md`](./DAILY-LIMITS.md).

### Daily Spent

The running total of stroops spent “today” via `pay_per_use()` for a specific subscriber. It is tracked in temporary storage with the same TTL behavior as the daily limit. It’s used to enforce that spend does not exceed the configured daily limit.

Source: `contract/src/spending_limit.rs`, `DataKey::DailySpent(user)`.

### DailyLimitStatus

Snapshot returned by `get_daily_limit_status()` containing the configured limit, current-window spend, window start, and remaining allowance.

Source: [`API.md`](./API.md#dailylimitstatus), [`DAILY-LIMITS.md`](./DAILY-LIMITS.md).

See also: [Daily Limit](#daily-limit), [Daily Limit Window](#daily-limit-window).

### Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)

Off-chain queue (Redis list, SQS, or JSONL file) where keepers place `batch_charge` pages or addresses that exhausted retries. Operators drain transient failures via replay scripts; permanent failures (e.g. `GracePeriodElapsed`) are archived. Not an on-chain contract type.

Source: [`operations/keeper_runbook.md`](./operations/keeper_runbook.md#dead-letter-queue-recovery), [`KEEPER.md`](./KEEPER.md).

## E

### Events

The contract emits structured events for key lifecycle operations and state transitions. Off-chain services (indexers, dashboards) rely on these events for analytics and for driving keeper workflows. See `docs/EVENTS.md` for the canonical schema, and `docs/EVENT-DRIVEN-GUIDE.md` for polling, deduplication, reaction patterns, and reliability.

Source: `contract/src/events.rs`, `docs/EVENTS.md`, `docs/EVENT-DRIVEN-GUIDE.md`.

See also: [Indexer](#indexer), [`EVENT-MAPPING.md`](../scripts/EVENT-MAPPING.md).

## F

### Fee BPS

Fee configuration expressed in basis points (BPS). The contract uses fee BPS to compute a protocol fee split during eligible recurring charges. Fee BPS values are set via proposal/commit and exposed through getters.

Source: `contract/src/fee.rs`, `DataKey::FeeBps`, `propose_fee()` / `commit_fee()`.

See also: [Fee Bounds](#fee-bounds), [Fee Collector](#fee-collector).

### Fee Bounds

Admin-configured minimum and maximum fee rates (`MinFeeBps` and `MaxFeeBps`). The bounds are checked when set and again when a proposed fee is committed; violations are errors 34 and 35.

Source: [`MAINNET-DEPLOYMENT.md`](./MAINNET-DEPLOYMENT.md#1-fee-bounds), [`API.md`](./API.md).

See also: [Fee BPS](#fee-bps), [Protocol Fee](#protocol-fee).

### Fee Collector

The address that receives protocol-fee transfers (when a fee is configured). It is paired with Fee BPS in fee configuration. The keeper or payment execution path may transfer funds to this address.

Source: `contract/src/fee.rs`, `DataKey::FeeCollector`.

See also: [Merchant Fee Recipient](#merchant-fee-recipient), [Protocol Fee](#protocol-fee).

## G

### Grace Period

The configured grace duration (in seconds) applied to recurring charge eligibility. During the grace period, charges are accepted even if they occur shortly after the scheduled time. After the grace period elapses, charging is prevented.

Source: `contract/src/grace.rs`, `DataKey::GracePeriod`.

### Grace Period Proposal / Commit

Two-step workflow for updating the grace period, similar to other admin-configured parameters. A proposer sets a pending value, then an admin commits the change to make it active. This avoids instantaneous misconfiguration.

Source: `contract/src/grace.rs`, `DataKey::PendingGracePeriod`.

### Global Volume Cap

A protocol-wide hourly transfer-volume limit. `GLOBAL_MAX_VOLUME_PER_HOUR` is the default; `set_global_volume_cap()` stores an instance `GlobalVolumeCapOverride`. `get_global_volume_cap()` and `get_global_volume_window()` expose the effective cap and current window. Exceeding the cap raises error 28, a non-positive override raises error 33, and updates emit `global_volume_cap_set`.

Source: [`limits.md`](./limits.md#global-hourly-volume-cap), [`MAINNET-DEPLOYMENT.md`](./MAINNET-DEPLOYMENT.md#2-volume-cap), `contract/src/events.rs`.

See also: [`API.md`](./API.md#contractconfig), [`ERROR-CODES.md`](./ERROR-CODES.md).

## H

### HealthReport

Struct returned by `contract_health_check()`. Fields include `is_healthy`, `contract_paused`, `schema_version`, `fee_collector_set`, and `global_volume_utilization_pct`. **`instance_ttl_ledgers` is a hardcoded lower-bound estimate (100_000) on-chain** — not a precise remaining TTL. `fee_collector_set` and volume utilization are informational and do **not** affect `is_healthy`.

Source: [`API.md`](./API.md#healthreport), `contract/src/lib.rs`.

See also: [`SubscriptionHealth`](#subscriptionhealth), [`DailyLimitStatus`](#dailylimitstatus).

## I

### Indexer

Off-chain service that persists contract events in the SQLite `events` table for queries, reporting, and compliance workflows. The schema and event-to-column mapping are documented separately from the on-chain event definitions.

Source: [`EVENT-MAPPING.md`](../scripts/EVENT-MAPPING.md), [`COMPLIANCE.md`](./COMPLIANCE.md).

See also: [Events](#events), [`EVENT-DRIVEN-GUIDE.md`](./EVENT-DRIVEN-GUIDE.md).

## K

### Keeper

The off-chain process responsible for triggering scheduled recurring charges. The keeper is the only required runtime piece for billing automation, because the contract does not schedule itself. Keeper workflows call `charge()` or `batch_charge()`, page the subscriber index, and log each [`ChargeResult`](#chargeresult). Production scripts live under `scripts/` (see [`scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md)).

Source: [`KEEPER.md`](./KEEPER.md), [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md#system-overview).

## L

### Locked/Eligibility Checks (Interval)

The contract enforces that recurring charges only occur when the billing interval has elapsed. If the call is made too early, the operation returns an interval-related error/result. Interval rules apply to both `charge()` and `batch_charge()` paths.

Source: `contract/src/charge_exec.rs`, `ContractError::IntervalNotElapsed`.

### Min Interval

The minimum allowed billing interval floor configured by admin. This prevents subscriptions from being created with intervals that are too short. The contract exposes `set_min_interval()` / `get_min_interval()`.

Source: `contract/src/min_interval.rs`, `DataKey::MinInterval`.

## M

### Merchant

The receiving party for subscription payments and protocol-fee splits. Merchants are typically whitelisted (optional) and can be frozen to block charges. Revenue accounting is tracked per merchant.

Source: `contract/src/whitelist.rs`, `contract/src/merchant_stats.rs`.

See also: [Merchant Integration Cookbook](./MERCHANT-INTEGRATION.md).

### Merchant Fee Recipient

Optional per-merchant destination for that merchant's protocol-fee share. If unset, fees use the global fee collector; charge events record the actual destination in `paid_to`.

Source: [`MULTI-TOKEN.md`](./MULTI-TOKEN.md), [`EVENT-MAPPING.md`](../scripts/EVENT-MAPPING.md).

See also: [Fee Collector](#fee-collector), [Protocol Fee](#protocol-fee).

### Merchant Frozen

A merchant-level state that prevents charges to a frozen merchant. This is independent of the global contract pause. When enabled, attempts to charge such merchants fail with merchant freeze related errors/panics.

Source: `contract/src/whitelist.rs`, `DataKey::MerchantFrozen(merchant)`.

### Merchant Revenue

The cumulative amount credited to a merchant across all successful charges and eligible one-time payments. It is stored as a running total and exposed via `get_merchant_revenue()`. Daily buckets are tracked separately.

Source: `contract/src/merchant_stats.rs`, `DataKey::MerchantRevenue(merchant)`.

### Merchant Revenue Day Bucket

A persistent daily bucket for per-day revenue analytics. The contract stores revenue keyed by merchant and day identifier. This enables reporting via `get_merchant_revenue_history()`.

Source: `contract/src/merchant_stats.rs`, `DataKey::MerchantRevenueDay(merchant, day)`.

### MultiEndpointServer

TypeScript RPC wrapper in `scripts/rpc-client.ts` that load-balances and failovers across comma-separated `RPC_URLS`. Used by keeper, indexer, health-check, and other scripts instead of a single `Server` instance. Validates network passphrase against the active endpoint.

Source: [`scripts/rpc-client.ts`](../scripts/rpc-client.ts), [`README.md`](../README.md).

## P

### Permissionless Charge

A design choice where charging for recurring payments can be invoked without `user.require_auth()`. This enables keepers to call `charge()` and `batch_charge()` for any eligible subscriber. Eligibility is still validated on-chain (interval, pause, grace period, merchant freeze, etc.).

Source: `docs/API.md` (Auth lines), `contract/src/charge_exec.rs`.

### PayPerUseSimResult

Read-only outcome returned by `simulate_pay_per_use()` and `simulate_pay_per_use_to()`. Its ten variants describe whether a one-time payment would succeed or which eligibility check would prevent it.

Source: [`API.md`](./API.md#payperusesimresult), `contract/src/charge_exec.rs`.

See also: [`ChargeSimResult`](#chargesimresult), [DailyLimitStatus](#dailylimitstatus).

### pause_until

Subscriber-initiated bounded pause: `pause_until(user, expiry)` sets `paused = true` with a ledger `expiry`. When `now >= expiry`, the next `charge()` or `batch_charge()` **auto-resumes** the subscription before eligibility checks. Distinct from indefinite `pause()` (expiry stored as `u64::MAX`). Requires `expiry > now` or the contract panics `InvalidPauseExpiry`.

Source: [`SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md`](./SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md#bounded-pause--pause_untiluser-expiry), `contract/src/lib.rs`.

See also: [Auto-Resume](#auto-resume), [`pause-lifecycle.md`](./architecture/pause-lifecycle.md).

### Prorated Refund

Refund issued by `cancel_and_refund_prorated()` for the unused portion of a subscription period. The merchant must match the subscription, the refund must be positive, and the merchant must have enough balance; failures use errors 38-40.

Source: [`SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md`](./SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md#cancellation-and-prorated-refund), [`ERROR-CODES.md`](./ERROR-CODES.md).

See also: [`API.md`](./API.md), [`cancel-results.md`](./cancel-results.md).

### Protocol Fee

The protocol-level fee charged on recurring billing flows, expressed using fee BPS and transferred to the configured fee collector address. Fees may be skipped based on configuration or special cases (e.g., 0 BPS). Fee behavior is part of the `charge()` execution.

Source: `contract/src/fee.rs`, `docs/API.md` describing protocol fee accounting.

See also: [Fee Bounds](#fee-bounds), [Fee Collector](#fee-collector), [Merchant Fee Recipient](#merchant-fee-recipient).

### Protocol Stats

A read-only view summarizing on-chain protocol configuration and runtime health counters. It includes active counts, fee configuration, grace period, whitelist enabled flag, schema version, and contract pause state. Exposed via `get_protocol_stats()`.

Source: `contract/src/lib.rs`, `ProtocolStats` struct.

## R

### Referrer

An optional address recorded at subscription creation time. The contract stores the referrer for later retrieval and emits a `referred` event. This can be used to support referral analytics. PayFlow does not automatically pay referrers on-chain; see [REFERRALS.md](./REFERRALS.md) for architecture and off-chain payout patterns.

Source: `contract/src/referral.rs`, `get_referrer()`, `DataKey::Referral(user)`.

### Replay Safety (Idempotent Migration)

A property where certain admin workflows (like `migrate`) can be called multiple times safely. This reduces operational risk during upgrades. In the docs, this is described as “safe to call multiple times.”

Source: `contract/src/migration.rs`, `migrate()` docs in `docs/API.md`.

## S

### SAC Token (Subscription Allowance Currency)

The token contract used as the payment asset for subscription and one-time transfers. It is stored/selected during `initialize()` and used for `transfer_from` calls. In docs, SAC is the token required for subscription payments.

Source: `contract/src/lib.rs` (initialize token docs), `contract/src/token.rs`.

### Schema Version (Storage Schema Version)

See [Contract Schema Version](#contract-schema-version). The `schema_version` field inside `HealthReport` and `ProtocolStats` mirrors `get_schema_version()` at read time.

Source: `contract/src/lib.rs` (`ProtocolStats`, `HealthReport`), `contract/src/migration.rs`.

### SubscriptionHealth

Per-subscriber diagnostic returned by `get_subscription_health(user)` as `SubscriptionHealth` (`active`, `charge_due`, `within_grace`, `has_sufficient_allowance`, `is_paused`, `trial_active`, `daily_limit_set`). Used by the frontend widget and `scripts/subscriber-health-dashboard.ts`. **Not** the same as [`HealthReport`](#healthreport) (protocol-wide) or keeper HTTP health.

Source: `contract/src/lib.rs`, [`API.md`](./API.md).

See also: [`HealthReport`](#healthreport), [DailyLimitStatus](#dailylimitstatus).

### Subscription

A stored record representing a subscriber’s recurring billing agreement. It includes merchant, amount, interval, next-charge tracking fields, active/paused flags, selected token, optional referrer, a label, and an optional trial duration. The contract returns it via `get_subscription()`.

Source: `contract/src/lib.rs` (`Subscription` struct), `DataKey::Subscription(user)`.

See also: [Subscription Transfer](#subscription-transfer), [Subscription Metadata](#subscription-metadata).

### Subscription Metadata

A short, human-readable label attached to a subscription (e.g., plan name). It’s set via `set_metadata()` and read via `get_metadata()` / `get_subscription_label()`. Metadata is stored separately from the core subscription record.

Source: `contract/src/subscription_metadata.rs`, `DataKey::SubscriptionMeta(user)`.

### Subscription Transfer

`transfer_subscription()` moves a caller's subscription to a new address, subject to the target not already having an active subscription. Related subscription data is moved with it.

Source: [`API.md`](./API.md#transfer_subscription), [`SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md`](./SUBSCRIBER-LIFECYCLE.md).

See also: [Subscription](#subscription), [`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md).

### Subscriber

A user address that owns a subscription record and may authorize one-time or recurring spend operations. Subscriber identity is used as the primary key for subscription storage and charge history. Many functions take a `user: Address` parameter representing the subscriber.

Source: `docs/API.md` (parameter naming), `contract/src/lib.rs` (`Subscription(Address)` keys).

## T

### Two-Step Authorization

Sensitive admin changes are staged and then applied in a second call. Fee, grace-period, and upgrade flows use Propose → Commit; admin transfer uses Propose → Accept, requiring the proposed admin to authorize acceptance.

Source: [`two-step-auth.md`](./architecture/two-step-auth.md), [`API.md`](./API.md).

See also: [Admin](#admin), [Grace Period Proposal / Commit](#grace-period-proposal--commit).

### Trial Duration / Trial Period

A subscriber-specific optional delay before the first recurring charge after subscription creation. It is specified during subscription calls and used to compute trial end time. The end timestamp is exposed via `get_trial_end()`.

Source: `contract/src/trial.rs`, `Subscription.trial_duration`, `get_trial_end()`.

## U

### TTL (Time-To-Live)

A storage lifetime mechanism used for temporary entries (e.g., daily limits) and for refreshing persistent entries. The contract relies on TTL behavior to automatically expire daily limit configuration and spend counters. Some persistent entries are refreshed via TTL extensions.

Source: docs in `docs/API.md` and `contract/src/storage.rs`.

## W

### Whitelist Enabled

A global toggle enabling merchant whitelist checks during subscription creation and/or charge eligibility. When enabled, merchants must be present in the whitelist to accept subscriptions. It is stored in instance storage and exposed via `set_whitelist_enabled()` / `is_whitelist_enabled()`.

Source: `contract/src/whitelist.rs`, `DataKey::WhitelistEnabled`.

### Whitelisted Merchant

A merchant address allowed to participate when the whitelist is enabled. Whitelist membership is updated via `add_merchant()` and `remove_merchant()`. Charge eligibility may fail if the merchant is not whitelisted.

Source: `contract/src/whitelist.rs`, `DataKey::MerchantWhitelist(merchant)`.
