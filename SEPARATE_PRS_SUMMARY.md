### PR 1: Component Naming Collision

**Branch:** `fix/issue1-component-naming`  
**Title:** `fix: rename SubscriptionRepairPanel components to resolve naming collision`

**Description:**
```
Resolves naming ambiguity between subscriber-facing and admin-facing repair panels.

## Problem
Two components shared the name SubscriptionRepairPanel, causing ambiguity and leaving
the subscriber-facing recovery flow unreachable in production.

## Solution
- Renamed subscriber component → SubscriberRecoveryPanel
- Renamed admin component → AdminRepairPanel
- Integrated SubscriberRecoveryPanel into Dashboard.tsx
- Updated all test files and imports

## Changes
- 5 renamed components/test files
- 2 modified files (Dashboard.tsx, AdminDashboard.tsx)
- 0 TypeScript diagnostics

## Testing
- All test files updated with correct imports
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Pass
```

**Files Changed:** 7 frontend files

### PR 2/3: CancelResult Expansion

**Branch:** `fix/issue2-3-cancel-result-expansion`  
**Title:** `fix: expand CancelResult enum to distinguish paused and frozen-merchant cancellations`

**Description:**
```
Adds PausedCancelled and MerchantFrozen variants to batch_cancel return values.

## Problem
batch_cancel returned only 3 outcomes. Admins could not distinguish routine cancels
from those hitting paused or frozen subscriptions.

## Solution
- Added PausedCancelled (discriminant 3)
- Added MerchantFrozen (discriminant 4)
- Updated batch_cancel logic to detect unusual states
- MerchantFrozen takes precedence over PausedCancelled

## Changes
- contract/src/batch.rs (enum + logic)
- docs/cancel-results.md (new documentation)
- scripts/EVENT-MAPPING.md (updated)
- contract_tests_addon.rs (3 new tests)

## Backward Compatibility
✅ Maintained - discriminants 0-2 unchanged

## Testing
- 3 new tests created for new variants
- Tests pending integration into contract/src/test.rs
```

**Files Changed:** 4 files (1 contract, 2 docs, 1 tests)

---

### PR 3: Resume Documentation

**Branch:** `fix/issue4-resume-documentation`  
**Title:** `docs: document resume recovery matrix and clock state interactions`

**Description:**
```
Expands resume function documentation with comprehensive recovery guidance.

## Problem
Three overlapping clocks (interval, grace period, pause expiry) produce a matrix of
outcomes that was only discoverable by reading multiple modules.

## Solution
Expanded resume function doc comment with:
- Complete recovery matrix table
- Clear rules for resume, cancel, and re-subscribe
- Explicit error codes
- Cross-references to related docs

## Recovery Matrix
| State | Action | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Paused, grace not lapsed | resume | ✅ Success |
| Paused, grace lapsed | resume | ❌ Error: ResumeGraceLapsed (43) |
| Paused, grace lapsed | cancel | ✅ Success (always allowed) |
| Paused, grace lapsed | re-subscribe | ✅ Success |

## Changes
- contract/src/lib.rs (documentation only)

## Backward Compatibility
✅ No behavior changes - documentation only

## Testing
- 3 new test scenarios documented
- Tests in contract_tests_addon.rs
```

**Files Changed:** 1 file (documentation only)

5. Set base branch to `master` (or your main branch)

### Or Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# PR 1
gh pr create --base master --head fix/issue1-component-naming \
  --title "fix: rename SubscriptionRepairPanel components to resolve naming collision" \
  --body-file ISSUE1_COMMIT.txt

# PR 2/3
gh pr create --base master --head fix/issue2-3-cancel-result-expansion \
  --title "fix: expand CancelResult enum to distinguish paused and frozen-merchant cancellations" \
  --body-file ISSUE2_3_COMMIT.txt

  --title "docs: document resume recovery matrix and clock state interactions" \
  --body-file ISSUE4_COMMIT.txt
```

## 📊 PR Strategy

### Recommended Merge Order:

1. **Issue 1** (Component Naming) - Independent, can merge first
2. **Issue 4** (Documentation) - Independent, documentation only
3. **Issue 2/3** (CancelResult) - Last, as it has test files to integrate

### Review Focus:

**PR 1:**
- Component renames are correct
- Dashboard integration works
- No broken imports

**PR 2/3:**
- Enum discriminants append-only
- batch_cancel logic correct
- Documentation comprehensive

**PR 3:**
- Documentation clarity
- Recovery matrix completeness
- No behavior changes

## 🔄 After PRs Are Merged

1. **Integrate tests** from `contract_tests_addon.rs` into `contract/src/test.rs`
2. **Run validation:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run typecheck
   cd contract && cargo test
   ```
3. **Delete feature branches** (GitHub can do this automatically)

## 📁 Local Cleanup

After all PRs are merged, clean up your local branches:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git branch -d fix/issue1-component-naming
git branch -d fix/issue2-3-cancel-result-expansion
git branch -d fix/issue4-resume-documentation
```
